we have nothin' in common poodle i'm a doberman pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage pupil it's me my honesty's brutal but it's honestly futile if i don't utilize what i do though for good at least once in a while so i wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch i scribble and doodle enough rhymes to maybe try to help get some people through tough times but i gotta keep a few punchlines just in case 'cause even you unsigned rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime i know there was a time where once i was king of the underground but i still rap like i'm on my pharoahe monch grind so i crunch rhymes but sometimes when you combine appeal with the skin color of mine you get too big and here they come tryin' to censor you like that one line i said on i'm back from the mathers lp  when i tried to say i'll take seven kids from columbine put 'em all in a line add an ak47 a revolver and a 9 see if i get away with it now that i ain't as big as i was but i'm

ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and i'm devastating more than ever demonstrating how to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating never fading and i know the haters are forever waiting for the day that they can say i fell off they'll be celebrating 'cause i know the way to get 'em motivated i make elevating music you make elevator music oh he's too mainstream well that's what they do when they get jealous they confuse it it's not hiphop it's pop'cause i found a hella way to fuse it with rock shock rap with doc throw on lose yourself and make 'em lose it i don't know how to make songs like that i don't know what words to use let me know when it occurs to you while i'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you it's curtains i'm inadvertently hurtin' you how many verses i gotta murder to prove that if you were half as nice your songs you could sacrifice virgins too ugh school flunky pill junkie but look at the accolades these skills brung me full of myself but still hungry i bully myself 'cause i make me do what i put my mind to and i'm a million leagues above you ill when i speak in tongues but it's still tongueincheek fuck you i'm drunk so satan take the fucking wheel i'ma sleep in the front seat bumpin' heavy d and the boyz still chunky but funky but in my head there's something i can feel tugging and struggling angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me they're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate but if you take into consideration the bitter hatred i have then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation and understand the discrimination but fuck it life's handin' you lemons make lemonade then but if i can't batter the women how the fuck am i supposed to bake them a cake then don't mistake him for satan it's a fatal mistake if you think i need to be overseas and take a vacation to trip a broad and make her fall on her face and don't be a retardbe a king think not why be a king when you can be a god

willing to borrow your grass but i specialize in eating mc's in the immortal words of ll cool j as he would say i'm a goat and for those of y'all who don't know what a goat is it means the greatest of all time and i consider myself one of those so thank you very much here it goes   this is the part i was worried about everyone thinks that my career is down the tubes and i'm in some dusty garage inhalin' them carbon monoxide fumes and everyone's tellin' me what i should do and how i should come out and what to rap about and i know i got a lot up in my medulla oblongata that i gotta get out and i'm not sure how this is gonna come off they're probably gonna think that i'm comin' off as cocky like i just started givin' a fuck what you really think about me see the thing about me is you don't really know a thing about me everyone's makin' a stink about me like there's some kind of an aura of that of the king around me surround me with nothin' but gangsters killers and bangers and the most dangerous criminals and i feel like i'm more comfortable around them than i do my own motherfuckin' neighbors but see my dream is to be remembered as one of the best when i leave but why does it seem like i'm not even put up in the same category as other mc's so when weezy says that he's better than jay z please be that just subliminally means he thinks jigga's the best and that he's the only one up in that league see and it's easy just to consider me one of the greatest white rappers there is knowin' goddamn well that i'm one of the best motherfuckin' rappers who ever lived period  hook i'm a goat and i don't mean to gloat but i know what i know and i know what you think and these magazines'll never put it in ink because how would it look if they considered me as a goat and for those of y'all who don't know what a goat is it means the greatest of all time and i consider myself one of those so thank you very much here it goes   maybe they figure that i'm on my way out the game so they gotta go try to find 'em a new eminem or a new shady if they think it's gonna happen man i thought i was crazy or maybe i could be takin' it wrong and they're tryna pay homage to me in a strange way so let me pay homage to my fellow white competitors almost in the same way see you hardly ever do hear anyone even bringin' up that paul wall's white cause lyrically he doesn't pose a threat to anyone see he's just aight and bubba sparxxx he just won't write because he's so caught up in that snow white that timbaland can't even get him in the studio he's so gone off that coke right and it's so sad cause he's dope right america's next great white hope right so now they feel like they gotta come up with some cornyass white rapper show right and which i'm still havin' mixed feelings about they said it'd be real i'm just spillin' it out there's somethin' about a white boy talkin' black and runnin' around with a damn grill in his mouth and i love when the say that tiger woods shit isn't it ironic that the best rapper's white and the best golfer's black and i'm the one who's gotta catch all the flack off of that but these are the people who never had heard of an eminem until 8 mile had came out but i had already hit middle america parents had all got to likin' me now when suddenly i wasn't such a bad guy all of the hatred for me must've died thought i committed career suicide so i had to turn back into the bad guy so faggoty faggoty faggoty gays anatomy god made raggedy ann and andy not raggedy andy and andy and andy and angelina jolie is just another ho and brad is a sucka because once i fuck her she wants to go to somalia to adopt another baby you know what i say  no you better save some of them kids from madonna she needs all the publicity she can get you wanted shady well you got it man i ain't apologizin' for shit  hook i'm a goat and i don't mean to gloat but i know what i know and i know what you think and these magazines'll never put it in ink because how would it look if they considered me as a goat and for those of y'all who don't know what a goat is it means the greatest of all time and i consider myself one of those so thank you very much here it goes   man i'm takin' my ball and goin' home man shit is too easy nobody even wants to pass me the ball cause i'm a goat so don't worry i'm out the motherfuckin' game and y'all can sit and argue about who's the motherfuckin' best but y'all know that i'm a goat and like i said i'm one of the motherfuckin' best before you get your panties in a motherfuckin' bunch but before i go i'd like to say fuck you very much to everybody who wasn't there from the start and thank you very much to everybody who was and y'all ain't gotta say it just think it cause i know that you know that i know that you know that i know that i'm a goat i'm out y'all it's been realpeace

pants up we 'bout to roll up and throw your ass in the van cuffed you don't have to know our plans or what our intentions are our cards are close to our chest you better show your hands and put our minds more at ease or get shot in the thyroid comply or die boy we're fightin' a crime war here come the swine tryna clean up the streets from all these minorities that's what we call 'em pigsties for they're like eyesores to police talk to you like just a piece of trash feels like we're stuck in a time warp to me as i kick these facts and get these mixed reactions as this beat backspins it's like we're drifting back in to the sixties having black skin is risky 'cause this keeps happening throughout history africanamericans have been treated like shit and i admit there have been times where

'em say die nword than die antwoord ninja now it's better disguised banter but that's life strapped 'cause we're strapped financially and can't find answers we're applying but mcdonald's seems to be the only franchise that'll hire so how can we have higher standards as dallas overshadows the battle for black lives matter we fight back with violence but acts like that are black eyes on the movement which makes black lives madder at cops and cops madder that's why it's at a stalemate and can't arrive at a compromise so it's black ops i wonder if we hire more black cops the crap stops the block is our backyards officers not the crack spot call the attack dogs off of us man you always act all pissed off at us at a traffic stop and bad cops fuck it up for the good cops and man stop sendin' white cops in the black neighborhoods who ain't acclimated to 'em like that's the way to do it who seen some fuckin' videos of rappers waving guns and know nobody black so they act afraid of us and that's racism the fear that a black face gives 'em a subconscious racist wait why are there black neighborhoods 'cause america segregated us designated us to an area separated us sectioneight'd us when we tear it ups the only time attentions paid to us and education sucks and every day's another freddie gray for us a levy breaks or fuzz why is it they treat us like dryer lint we just want a safe environment for our kids but cant escape the sirens dont take a scientist to see our violent nature lies in the poverty that we face so the crime rates the highest in the lowest classes it's like a razor wire fence and were trapped in these racial biases that plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise every time we see a devils face lions tigers and bears oh my it's more like billy clubs and gats and we really love it when you think were guilty cause were black but you kill each other facts you peel each other's caps for silly stuff like hats single mother strugglin through substance abuse while people with nothin' to lose shoot each other for shoes fuck your republican views pull ourselves up by our bootstraps where the fuck are the boots and streets act as a narrator don't gotta read comics or be that into characters just to see that just to be black you better be strapped with a derringer or be capped in america like steve rogers 'cause no one oversees these cops and all we see is 'em beat charges we done seen 'em beat rodney king unconscious and got off so we don't need all you crooked police officers' peace offerings just keep marchin' 'til we reach congress but they're gonna say you're tryin' to take an irrational stance if you try to slander the flag but somebody has to be the sacrificial lamb so they call it a kaepernick tantrum if you don't stand for the national anthem we raise it you better praise it or you'll be made to feel like a traitor we'll treat you like rodney dangerfield home of the brave is still racist 'ville so this
