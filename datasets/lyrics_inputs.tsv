Am I living it right? Am I living it right? Why Georgia, why?   I rent a room and I fill the spaces with Wood in places to make it feel like home But all I feel's alone It might be a quarter life crisis Or just the stirring in my soul   Either way--I wonder sometimes About the outcome Of a still verdictless life   Am I living it right? Am I living it right? Am I living it right? Why Georgia, why?   So what, so I've got a smile on But it's hiding the quiet superstitions in my head Don't believe me Don't believe me When I say I've got it down   Everybody is just a stranger but That's the danger in going my own way I guess it's the price I have to pay   Still everything happens for a reason Is no reason not to ask myself   Am I living it right? Am I living it right? Am I living it right? Why? Tell me why? Why? Why Georgia, why?
