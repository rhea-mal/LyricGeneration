Phoebe Bridgers,Killer, Sometimes I think I'm a killer I scared you in your house I even scared myself by talking About Dahmer on your couch But I can't sleep next to a body Even harmless in death Plus I'm pretty sure I'd miss you And faking sleep to count your breath   Can the killer in me Tame the fire in you? Or is there nothing left to do for us? I am sick of the chase But I'm hungry for blood And there's nothing I can do   But when I'm sick and tired And when my mind is barely there When a machine keeps me alive And I'm losing all my hair I hope you kiss my rotten head And pull the plug Know that I've burned every playlist And I've given all my love   Can the killer in me Tame the fire in you?

James Bay,Let It Go, From walking home and talking loads To seeing shows in evening clothes with you From nervous touch and getting drunk To staying up and waking up with you   Now we're sleeping near the edge Holding something we don't need All this delusion in our heads Is gonna bring us to our knees   So come on let it go just let it be Why don't you be you and I'll be me? Everything that's broke leave it to the breeze Why don't you be you and I'll be me? And I'll be me   From throwing clothes across the floor To teeth and claws and slamming doors at you If this is all we're living for Why are we doing it doing it doing it anymore?   I used to recognize myself It's funny how reflections change When we're becoming something else I think it's time to walk away   So come on let it go just let it be Why don't you be you and I'll be me? Everything that's broke leave it to the breeze Why don't you be you and I'll be me? And I'll be me   Tryna fit your hand inside of mine When we know it just don't belong 'Cause no force on earth could make it feel right no no Tryna push this problem up the hill When it's just too heavy to hold I think now's the time to let it slide   So come on let it go just let it be Why don't you be you and I'll be me?

Ed Sheeran,Eraser, I was born inside a small town I lost that state of mind Learned to sing inside the Lord's house but stopped the age of nine I forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride The paving stones I played upon that kept me on the grind So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride And when the world's against me is when I really come alive And every day that Satan tempts me I try to take it in my stride You know that I've got whisky with white lies and smoke in my lungs I think life has got to the point I know without it's no fun I need to get in the right mind and clear myself up Instead I look in the mirror questioning what I've become Guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me Without a nine-to-five job or a uni degree To be caught up in the trappings of the industry Show me the locked doors I'll find another use for the key And you'll see   I'm well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me But with that said give me one more   Another one to take the sting away I am happy on my own so here I'll stay Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser   I used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs I chased the pictured perfect life I think they painted it wrong I think that money is the root of all evil and fame is hell Relationships and hearts you fixed they break as well And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps Because you're living your dream man this shit should be fun Please know that I'm not trying to preach like I'm Reverend Run I beg you don't be disappointed with the man I've become Conversations with my father on the A14 Age 12 telling me I've gotta chase those dreams Now I'm playing for the people dad and they know me With my beaten small guitar wearing the same old jeans Wembley Stadium crowd's 240 thou' I may have grown up but I hope that Damian's proud And to the next generation inspiration's allowed The world may be filled with hate but keep erasing it now Somehow   I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me But with that said give me one more   Another one to take the sting away Oh I am happy on my own so here I'll stay Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser   Welcome to the new show I guess you know I've been away But where I'm heading who knows?
