Phoebe Bridgers,Killer, Sometimes I think I'm a killer I scared you in your house I even scared myself by talking About Dahmer on your couch But I can't sleep next to a body Even harmless in death Plus I'm pretty sure I'd miss you And faking sleep to count your breath   Can the killer in me Tame the fire in you? Or is there nothing left to do for us? I am sick of the chase But I'm hungry for blood And there's nothing I can do   But when I'm sick and tired And when my mind is barely there When a machine keeps me alive And I'm losing all my hair I hope you kiss my rotten head And pull the plug Know that I've burned every playlist And I've given all my love   Can the killer in me Tame the fire in you? I know there's something waiting for us I am sick of the chase But I'm stupid in love And there's nothing I can do And there's nothing I can do,21YiaS85ngOoYT773cMFlW,51,183906,False,0.558,0.0578,8,-19.907,1,0.0337,0.921,0.961,0.0954,0.0575,80.021,4,anime

James Bay,Let It Go, From walking home and talking loads To seeing shows in evening clothes with you From nervous touch and getting drunk To staying up and waking up with you   Now we're sleeping near the edge Holding something we don't need All this delusion in our heads Is gonna bring us to our knees   So come on let it go just let it be Why don't you be you and I'll be me? Everything that's broke leave it to the breeze Why don't you be you and I'll be me? And I'll be me   From throwing clothes across the floor To teeth and claws and slamming doors at you If this is all we're living for Why are we doing it doing it doing it anymore?   I used to recognize myself It's funny how reflections change When we're becoming something else I think it's time to walk away   So come on let it go just let it be Why don't you be you and I'll be me? Everything that's broke leave it to the breeze Why don't you be you and I'll be me? And I'll be me   Tryna fit your hand inside of mine When we know it just don't belong 'Cause no force on earth could make it feel right no no Tryna push this problem up the hill When it's just too heavy to hold I think now's the time to let it slide   So come on let it go just let it be Why don't you be you and I'll be me? Everything that's broke leave it to the breeze Let the ashes fall forget about me   Come on let it go just let it be Why don't you be you and I'll be me?
