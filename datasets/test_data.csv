inadvertently hurtin' you how many verses i gotta murder to prove that if you were half as nice your songs you could sacrifice virgins too ugh school flunky pill junkie but look at the accolades these skills brung me full of myself but still hungry i bully myself 'cause i make me do what i put my mind to and i'm a million leagues above you ill when i speak in tongues but it's still tongueincheek fuck you i'm drunk so satan take the fucking wheel i'ma sleep in the front seat bumpin' heavy d and the boyz still chunky but funky but in my head there's something i can feel tugging and struggling angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me they're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate but if you take into consideration the bitter hatred i have then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation and understand the discrimination but fuck it life's handin' you lemons make lemonade then but if i can't batter the women how the fuck am i supposed to
