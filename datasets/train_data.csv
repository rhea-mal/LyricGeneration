John Mayer,Heartbreak Warfare," Lightning strikes Inside my chest to keep me up at night Dream of ways To make you understand my pain   Clouds of sulfur in the air Bombs are falling everywhere It's heartbreak warfare Once you want it to begin No one really ever wins In heartbreak warfare   If you want more love, why don't you say so? If you want more love, why don't you say so?  Verse  Drop his name Push it in and twist the knife again Watch my face As I pretend to feel no pain, pain, pain   Clouds of sulfur in the air Bombs are falling everywhere It's heartbreak warfare Once you want it to begin No one really ever wins In heartbreak warfare   If you want more love, why don't you say so? If you want more love, why don't you say so?   How come the only way to know how high you get me Is to see how far I fall? God only knows how much I'd love you if you let me But I can't break through it all   It's a heart, heartbreak I don't care if we don't sleep at all tonight Let's just fix this whole thing now I swear to God, we're going to get it right If you lay your weapon down   Red wine and Ambien You're talking shit again It's heartbreak warfare Good to know it's all a game Disappointment has a name It's heartbreak, heartbreak   It's heartbreak warfare It's heartbreak warfare It's heartbreak warfare",4gs07VlJST4bdxGbBsXVue,65,269720,False,0.624,0.554,2,-8.113,1,0.0225,0.191,0.00131,0.299,0.311,97.031,4,singer-songwriter

John Mayer,Why Georgia," I am driving up '85 in the Kind of morning that lasts all afternoon Just stuck inside the gloom 4 more exits to my apartment but I am tempted to keep the car in drive And leave it all behind   Because I wonder sometimes About the outcome Of a still verdictless life   Am I living it right? Am I living it right? Am I living it right? Why Georgia, why?   I rent a room and I fill the spaces with Wood in places to make it feel like home But all I feel's alone It might be a quarter life crisis Or just the stirring in my soul   Either way--I wonder sometimes About the outcome Of a still verdictless life   Am I living it right? Am I living it right? Am I living it right? Why Georgia, why?   So what, so I've got a smile on But it's hiding the quiet superstitions in my head Don't believe me Don't believe me When I say I've got it down   Everybody is just a stranger but That's the danger in going my own way I guess it's the price I have to pay   Still everything happens for a reason Is no reason not to ask myself   Am I living it right? Am I living it right? Am I living it right? Why? Tell me why? Why?

of us cannibals who cut other people open like cantaloupes but if we can hump dead animals and antelopes then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope but if you feel like i feel i got

Eminem,Bully,yo check it out it's fucked up 'cause i don't see either one of us budging   i'm withholdin' my anger though i'd like to be the strangler of this punk ass little pussy's puny neck it's my right to insist that he acknowledge my existence but he just displays complete lack of respect that's what he says to himself as he uses his magazines to trash me as he sits with both his feet up at his desk smokes a bag of his weed and starts imaginin' things and he just can't see that he's manically depressed and in his jealousy and envy it just whirls him in a frenzy as he turns on mtv and sees my face he don't exist in this world so he just twists and he twirls spirals and spins 'til he hurls himself into a rage and it's destroyin' him slowly 'cause he does not even know me even though he sees me everywhere he goes so he just tortures himself he has no fortune and wealth so he extorts someone else to get his dough and now he's actin' like a bully so he tries to push and pull me but he knows that he can't fool me so he's mad and he has no choice but to scream and raise his voice up at me 'cause it annoys him to see that i ain't scared   you ain't no motherfuckin' bully and i ain't bowin' to no motherfuckin' bully i won't allow it ain't gon' cower to no bully i'll be damned if i don't stand up to a bully fight like a man and throw my hands up to a bully and i know it must be fuckin' wit' you emotionally   now i'm not tryin' to make no more enemies no more unfortunately there's so many other motherfuckers there just are they just keep houndin' at me now that i'm down with 50 suddenly now i got beef with this faggot ja hahahaha but his ass is such a puppet irv could shove his whole hand up it and just make him say what he wants him to say but suge has irv on a string and irv's so nervous that he says anything to this man to keep him at bay so now ja thinks that he's so tough and murder inc's the big bad wolf and they go huff and puff and blow our label down but our building's made out of bricks so you ain't takin' out shit and dawg you just did a song with bobby brown so now you try to pull the race card and it backfires in your face hard 'cause you know we don't play that black and white shit plus this stylist you fucked when you was ecstasied up was just a man who's dressed up as a white bitch   you ain't no motherfuckin' bully and i ain't bowin' to no motherfuckin' bully i won't allow it ain't gon' cower to no bully i'll be damned if i don't stand up to a bully fight like a man and throw my hands up to a bully you must be takin' too much e   now what bothers me the most about hiphop is we're so close to pickin' up where we left off with big and pac we just lost jam master j big l got blasted away plus we lost bugz slang ton and freaky tah it's like a neverending cycle that just seems to come full circle everybody's gotta be so fuckin' hard and i'm not excludin' myself 'cause i been stupid as well i been known to lose it when someone says something smart but as we grow as men we learn to let shit go but then again there's only so much bullshit we can really stand we all got reps to uphold when someone steps on our toes it's no exception it goes for every man but if irv really gave a fuck about ja like he claims he does he'd wake him up and make his boy get off them drugs but he just keeps feedin' him pills so if that e doesn't kill him someone from gunit will and i ain't buzzed dawg i'm talkin' to you straight if the situation escalates any worse we're gonna lose another soldier to this game and if i get killed for this rap i got a million in cash that says i will get you back in hailie's name   you ain't no motherfuckin' bully and i ain't bowin' to no motherfuckin' bully i won't allow it ain't gon' cower to no bully i'll be damned if i don't stand up to a bully fight like a man and throw my hands up to a bully irvine get your boy off of that e   get at me dawg holla,3HhHP56irp6Z0c8q0gv6tK,31,242746,False,0.519,0.969,6,-2.34,0,0.0662,9.03e-05,0.0,0.111,0.48,77.011,4,grunge

Ed Sheeran,Little Lady," Listen, little lady This is just the worst way to spend your birthday, it's 30 degrees, Thursday You work late, you was with a perv making dirty fake love in his Mercedes Lady, the word rape sums up events that take place every night You wanna get up but you know your legs will ache if you try And you remember that your punter went crazy last night You drag yourself to the mirror to check your face then you cry Forget the visit to the clinic you was booked in for You'll make a trip to the Whittington where they'll look at your jaw They'll be inquisitive and ask about your business for sure They'll know you're fibbing if you tell them you got hit by a door But young woman, the pimp sees you as nothing but a dumb hooker Medical attention could be fatal cause the cunt wouldn't Ever let a doctor near someone that's getting dough for him Cause next you got poxy authorities sticking their noses in   She's just under the upper hand Goes mad for a couple grams And she don't wanna go outside, tonight Cause in a pipe she'll fly to the motherland and Sell love to another man It's too cold outside For angels to fly   Little lady, your mind you've made up Your injuries you can't hide with make-up You need some medical advice, you make up a little lie to say just In case the doc opens his eyes and don't decide to play dumb With any luck you'll see the same dude who stitched your top lip Last year when your pimp just lost it He wouldn't recognise you if you stared him in the face anyway Cause all the heroin is making you age But you're a heroine for taking the strain of being a prostitute and punching bag The funds you have left go where your from using MoneyGram Mother had to get you out the motherland to study That was all she struggled to have a single daughter with the upper hand Little does she know you're never coming back? She put you in her brother's hands only for him to formulate another plan He's the fucking cause of your appalling state, this summer Fancy that, you came to London to get pimped by your uncle, damn   She's just under the upper hand Goes mad for a couple grams And she don't wanna go outside, tonight Cause in a pipe she'll fly to the motherland and Sell love to another man It's too cold outside For angels to fly   An angel will die Covered in white Closed eyes and hoping for a better life This time, we'll fade out tonight Straight down the line   Little lady, you're trembling with fear Your skinny frame kinda resembles a deer You're sitting facing the detective, oh dear The meddling nurse couldn't just leave it She's only gone and made it much worse calling police and She'll never know the gravity of the damage she's caused You're causing scandal going mad in the ward now The cop is trying to calm you, telling you he won't let no one harm you The same question he keeps trying to ask you, Who you working for? He's talking to you like you're worth more than a dirty whore You're having a conversation you could be murdered for You're learning more about exactly why you need to help bring him or her to court It's kicking knowledge you ain't ever heard before Just before he leaves, he reassures you that he knows that it's hard He underlines a mobile number you can phone on his card Begs you to use it, he's useless if you're gonna be stupid Cause an answer hasn't come from your bruised lips, you're on your own You've gotta go and give your pimp what you owe You reach your door and then it dawns that you've been followed home Before you turn around you feel a cold blade on your throat And then a voice says, Where you been bitch? I wanna know No prizes for guessing who it is, resistance would be foolishness You open the front door, he boots you in There's something new in him, he's silent now that fills you with terror Get your alibi straight, you could be killed for an error He towers over you, the 6 inch knife catches the sunlight At this point your life flashes before your eyes, your handbag's dropped And all the contents are all over the floor Despite the mess there's only one thing that's caught his eye And in the moment of rage, he brutally murders his niece And dumps her body in the boot of his Mercs in the street Little lady left this earth in the worst way All because she got a card on her 13th birthday   And we're all under the upper hand And go mad for a couple grams And we don't wanna go outside, tonight Cause in a pipe she'll fly to the motherland and Sell love to another man It's too cold outside For angels to fly For angels to fly Fly, fly For angels to fly To fly, to fly Angels to die",6jR9Dj1h04dJxNu8lkmtGC,20,169000,False,0.653,0.731,4,-6.173,0,0.336,0.294,1.2e-06,0.466,0.681,117.64,4,j-dance

Hozier,Would That I," True that I saw her hair like the branch of a tree A willow dancing on air before covering me Under cotton and calicoes Over canopy dappled long ago True that love in withdrawal was the weepin' of me That the sound of the saw must be known by the tree Must be felled for to fight the cold Fretted fire but that was long ago   It's not tonight (Oh, oh) Where I'm set alight (Oh, oh) And I blink in sight (Oh, oh) Of your blinding light (Oh, oh) Oh, it's not tonight (Oh, oh) Where you hold me tight (Oh, oh) And the fire bright (Oh, oh) Oh, let it blaze alright (Oh, oh) Oh, but you're good to me, oh, you're good to me (Oh, oh) Oh, but that you're good to me, baby (Oh, oh)   With the roar of the fire, my heart rose to its feet Like the ashes of ash, I saw rise in the heat Settled soft and as pure as snow I fell in love with the fire long ago With each love I cut loose, I was never the same Watching still-living roots be consumed by the flame I was fixed on your hand of gold Layin' waste to my lovin' long ago   But that's not tonight (Oh, oh) Where I'm set alight (Oh, oh) And I blink in sight (Oh, oh) Of your blinding light (Oh, oh) And it's not tonight (Oh, oh) Where you hold me tight (Oh, oh) And the fire bright (Oh, oh) Oh, let it blaze alright, honey (Oh, oh) Oh, but you're good to me, oh, you're good to me (Oh, oh) Oh, but you're good to me, baby (Oh, oh)   So in awe, there I stood as you licked off the grain Though I've handled the wood, I still worship the flame As long as amber of ember glows All the would that I'd loved is long ago   And it's not tonight (Oh, oh) Where I'm set alight (Oh, oh) And I blink in sight (Oh, oh) Of your blinding light (Oh, oh) Oh, it's not tonight (Oh, oh) Where you hold me tight (Oh, oh) And the fire bright (Oh, oh) Oh, let it blaze alright (Oh, oh) Oh,  you're good to me, oh, you're good to me (Oh, oh) Oh, but you're good to me (Oh, oh) Oh, oh, you're good to me, you're good to me (Oh, oh) Oh, but you're good to me, baby (Oh, oh)",0L3oQdYUvVbsOOPJSkZ3C3,60,268293,False,0.521,0.526,5,-6.032,1,0.0281,0.243,0.00537,0.108,0.502,130.694,4,singer-songwriter
Ed Sheeran,Take It Back," I'm not a rapper, I'm a singer with a flow I've got a habit for spitting quicker lyrics, you know You'll find me ripping the writtens out of the pages they sit in I never want to get bitten 'cause plagiarism is hidden Watch how I sit on the rhythm, prisoner with the vision Signed to a label but didn't listen to any criticism Thought you knew but you didn't, so perk your ears up and listen Studio is a system and you could say that I'm driven And now it's onto the next saga, we drink the best lager I'll never try to win you over like your stepfather I'll do my own thing now and get respect after And I'm avoiding the 'caine like it was Get Carter For four years I never had a place to stay But it's safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight At 16 years old, yeah, I moved out of my home I was Macy Gray, I tried to say goodbye and I choked And went from sleeping at a subway station To sleeping with a movie star and adding to the population Not my imagination, I don't wanna relax Would it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax? I'll take it back now   Mmm, come on and take it back, love Come on and take it back for us Don't you fade into the back, love No   I take it back with the rhythm and blues With my rap pack, I'll be singing the news Tryna act like Jack Black when I bring it to school I'll make a beat with my feet by just hitting a loop Bringing the lyrics to prove that I can fit in these shoes I'll give you the truth through the vocal booth And stars burst out on the scene like an Opal Fruit They try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot But then again that's what they're supposed to do And I'm supposed to be calm, I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm Whispering, Everything that happens is from now on I'll be ready to start again by the end of the song And still they're claiming that I handle it wrong But then I've never had an enemy except the NME But I'll be selling twice as many copies as their magazines'll ever be With only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees Are healthier than a dalmatian on Pedigree Singing for the masses, rubber dinghy rapids I keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic I'm battling for respect, and I don't know if I'll have it This song's from the heart, covered the planet, I'll take it back now   Mmm, come on and take it back, love Come on and take it back for us Don't you fade into the back, love No, I'll take it back now   Now, I don't ever wanna be perfect 'Cause I'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless And I accept the fact that someone's gotta win worst-dressed Taking my first steps into the scene, giving me focus Putting on a brave face like Timothy Dalton Considering a name change, thinking it was hopeless Rhyming over recordings, avoiding tradition 'Cause every day some lyrics and a melody could be written Now absence can make your heart ache But drinking Absinthe can change your mind state Vividly, need to let my liver be And I'll say it again, living life on the edge with a closed handful of friends It's good advice from the man who took his life on the road with me And I hope to see him blowing up globally 'Cause that's how it's supposed to be, I'm screaming out vocally It might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams, but But I just write schemes I'm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans Madison Square Garden is where I might be, but more likely You'll find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates Having a pint with McDaid, discussing records we made And every single second knowing that we'll never betray The way we were raised, remembering our background, sat down That's how we plan it out, it's time to take it back now   Mmm, come on and take it back, love Come on and take it back for us Don't you fade into the back, love No Mmm, come on and take it back, love Come on and take it back for us Don't you fade into the back, love No   My dreams keep me awake at night, written in rhyme Till I deliver the hype, am I just living a lie? With this you must know that the numbers just sold Will keep me going through the tough times, dream with me We forget 90 percent of it when we wake But the other 10 percent, it never fades Dreaming dreams of day-to-day goals, stay awake loads Tried to make the cut like the paper with a razor blade Oh, never give up, just remember just to hold out more A couple years ago I couldn't just control that thought You'd find me busking on the street when it was cold outdoors Now I'm sweating on the stage of a sold-out tour Writing love songs for the sake of it, never to make a hit You can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick I'm not a rapper, I'm a singer, I just take the piss And most of these other guys are kids that pose His little sister has to babysit, that's just the way it is Dreams are your own, just set your goals and have the upmost faith in it Tread your own path, you'll never make it as a follower You'll never know where you will go or you will be tomorrow Igh!",2i4VsOvjYtbsm8KgPtnNFT,39,260179,False,0.409,0.991,5,-2.241,0,0.334,0.000333,8.98e-05,0.0838,0.17,173.948,4,drum-and-bass

Eminem,Untouchable,pt i   hands up officer dont shoot then pull your pants up promise you won't loot we may never understand each other its no use we aint ever gonna grasp what each other goes through   black boy black boy we ain't gonna lie to you black boy black boy we don't like the sight of you pull up on the side of you window rolled down 'profile' then we wonder why we see this side of you probably comin' from the dope house we could let you slide but your tail light is blew out we know you're hidin' that heidi klum on you another drug charge homie it's back inside for you and just in case a chase might ensue we got that tried and true pistol drew right at you we'd be delighted to unload it in your back then walk up and lay that taser on the side of you fucked up but what the fuck am i to do i keep tellin' myself keep doin' like you're doin' no matter how many lives you ruin it's for the red white and blue time to go find a new one and split his head right in two no one's ever indicted you why 'cause you're a   eminem  cheech and chong white boy white boy you're a rockstar my momma talkin' to me tryna tell me how to live white boy white boy in your cop car but i don't listen to her 'cause my head is like a sieve white boy white boy you're untouchable the world's coming to an end i don't even care nobody can tell me shit 'cause i'm a big rockstar   black boy black boy we don't get your culture and we don't care what our government's done to fuck you over man don't tell us your attitude's a result of that balderdash whered you get the chip on your shoulder at why you kicking that soda can pull your pants up we 'bout to roll up and throw your ass in the van cuffed you don't have to know our plans or what our intentions are our cards are close to our chest you better show your hands and put our minds more at ease or get shot in the thyroid comply or die boy we're fightin' a crime war here come the swine tryna clean up the streets from all these minorities that's what we call 'em pigsties for they're like eyesores to police talk to you like just a piece of trash feels like we're stuck in a time warp to me as i kick these facts and get these mixed reactions as this beat backspins it's like we're drifting back in to the sixties having black skin is risky 'cause this keeps happening throughout history africanamericans have been treated like shit and i admit there have been times where it's been embarrassin' to be a   eminem  cheech and chong white boy white boy you're a rockstar my momma talkin' to me tryna tell me how to live white boy white boy in your cop car but i don't listen to her 'cause my head is like a sieve white boy white boy you're untouchable the world's coming to an end i don't even care nobody can tell me shit 'cause i'm a big rockstar  pt ii   seems like the average lifespan of a white man is more than twice than a black life span i wonder sometimes if it has a price scanner i feel like checking out on life can't escape this circumstance i'd rather hear 'em say die nword than die antwoord ninja now it's better disguised banter but that's life strapped 'cause we're strapped financially and can't find answers we're applying but mcdonald's seems to be the only franchise that'll hire so how can we have higher standards as dallas overshadows the battle for black lives matter we fight back with violence but acts like that are black eyes on the movement which makes black lives madder at cops and cops madder that's why it's at a stalemate and can't arrive at a compromise so it's black ops i wonder if we hire more black cops the crap stops the block is our backyards officers not the crack spot call the attack dogs off of us man you always act all pissed off at us at a traffic stop and bad cops fuck it up for the good cops and man stop sendin' white cops in the black neighborhoods who ain't acclimated to 'em like that's the way to do it who seen some fuckin' videos of rappers waving guns and know nobody black so they act afraid of us and that's racism the fear that a black face gives 'em a subconscious racist wait why are there black neighborhoods 'cause america segregated us designated us to an area separated us sectioneight'd us when we tear it ups the only time attentions paid to us and education sucks and every day's another freddie gray for us a levy breaks or fuzz why is it they treat us like dryer lint we just want a safe environment for our kids but cant escape the sirens dont take a scientist to see our violent nature lies in the poverty that we face so the crime rates the highest in the lowest classes it's like a razor wire fence and were trapped in these racial biases that plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise every time we see a devils face lions tigers and bears oh my it's more like billy clubs and gats and we really love it when you think were guilty cause were black but you kill each other facts you peel each other's caps for silly stuff like hats single mother strugglin through substance abuse while people with nothin' to lose shoot each other for shoes fuck your republican views pull ourselves up by our bootstraps where the fuck are the boots and streets act as a narrator don't gotta read comics or be that into characters just to see that just to be black you better be strapped with a derringer or be capped in america like steve rogers 'cause no one oversees these cops and all we see is 'em beat charges we done seen 'em beat rodney king unconscious and got off so we don't need all you crooked police officers' peace offerings just keep marchin' 'til we reach congress but they're gonna say you're tryin' to take an irrational stance if you try to slander the flag but somebody has to be the sacrificial lamb so they call it a kaepernick tantrum if you don't stand for the national anthem we raise it you better praise it or you'll be made to feel like a traitor we'll treat you like rodney dangerfield home of the brave is still racist 'ville so this whole nation feels like a plantation field in a country that claims that its foundation was based on united states ideals that had its natives killed got you singin' this

Eminem,Groundhog Day,what is a nightmare the dictionary tells us it is a terrifying dream a nightmare   i used to think i had bad luck but i wasn't superstitious 'til one day i grew suspicious when i stepped on a crack on aunt edna's stoop and got pooped on by a group of stupid pigeons then we flew the coop to michigan to start anew but ditchin' missouri for michigan didn't work so we moved back to missouri from michigan from missouri back to michigan someone put me out my misery i can't do this again mom please stick to a decision discipline last thing i wanna do is listen she's like lex

Ed Sheeran,Eraser," I was born inside a small town, I lost that state of mind Learned to sing inside the Lord's house, but stopped the age of nine I forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride The paving stones I played upon that kept me on the grind So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride And when the world's against me is when I really come alive And every day that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride You know that I've got whisky with white lies, and smoke in my lungs I think life has got to the point, I know without it's no fun I need to get in the right mind, and clear myself up Instead, I look in the mirror questioning what I've become Guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me Without a nine-to-five job or a uni degree To be caught up in the trappings of the industry Show me the locked doors, I'll find another use for the key And you'll see   I'm well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me But with that said give me one more   Another one to take the sting away I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser   I used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs I chased the pictured perfect life, I think they painted it wrong I think that money is the root of all evil, and fame is hell Relationships, and hearts you fixed, they break as well And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps Because you're living your dream, man, this shit should be fun Please know that I'm not trying to preach like I'm Reverend Run I beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become Conversations with my father on the A14 Age 12 telling me I've gotta chase those dreams Now I'm playing for the people, dad, and they know me With my beaten small guitar, wearing the same old jeans Wembley Stadium crowd's 240 thou' I may have grown up, but I hope that Damian's proud And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed The world may be filled with hate, but keep erasing it now Somehow   I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me But with that said give me one more   Another one to take the sting away Oh, I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser   Welcome to the new show I guess you know I've been away But where I'm heading, who knows?
