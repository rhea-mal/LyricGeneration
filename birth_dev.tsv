I'll take it back now   Mmm, come on and take it back, love Come on and take it back for us Don't you fade into the back, love No   I take it back with the rhythm and blues With my rap pack, I'll be singing the news Tryna act like Jack Black when I bring it to school I'll make a beat with my feet by just hitting a loop Bringing the lyrics to prove that I can fit in these shoes I'll give you the truth through the vocal booth And stars burst out on the scene like an Opal Fruit They try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot But then again that's what they're supposed to do And I'm supposed to be calm, I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm Whispering, Everything that happens is from now on I'll be ready to start again by the end of the song And still they're claiming that I handle it wrong But then I've never had an enemy except the NME But I'll be selling twice as many copies as their magazines'll ever be With only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees Are healthier than a dalmatian on Pedigree Singing for the masses, rubber dinghy rapids I keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic I'm battling for respect, and I don't know if I'll have it This song's from the heart, covered the planet, I'll take it back now   Mmm, come on and take it back, love Come on and take it back for us Don't you fade into the back, love No, I'll take it back now   Now, I don't ever wanna be perfect 'Cause I'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless And I accept the fact that someone's gotta win worst-dressed Taking my first steps into the scene, giving me focus Putting on a brave face like Timothy Dalton Considering a name change, thinking it was hopeless Rhyming over recordings, avoiding tradition 'Cause every day some lyrics and a melody could be written Now absence can make your heart ache But drinking Absinthe can change your mind state Vividly, need to let my liver be And I'll say it again, living life on the edge with a closed handful of friends It's good advice from the man who took his life on the road with me And I hope to see him blowing up globally 'Cause that's how it's supposed to be, I'm screaming out vocally It might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams, but But I just write schemes I'm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans Madison Square Garden is where I might be, but more likely You'll find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates Having a pint with McDaid, discussing records we made And every single second knowing that we'll never betray The way we were raised, remembering our background, sat down That's how we plan it out, it's time to take it back now   Mmm, come on and take it back, love Come on and take it back for us Don't you fade into the back, love No Mmm, come on and take it back, love Come on and take it back for us Don't you fade into the back, love No   My dreams keep me awake at night, written in rhyme Till I deliver the hype, am I just living a lie? With this you must know that the numbers just sold Will keep me going through the tough times, dream with me We forget 90 percent of it when we wake But the other 10 percent, it never fades Dreaming dreams of day-to-day goals, stay awake loads Tried to make the cut like the paper with a razor blade Oh, never give up, just remember just to hold out more A couple years ago I couldn't just control that thought You'd find me busking on the street when it was cold outdoors Now I'm sweating on the stage of a sold-out tour Writing love songs for the sake of it, never to make a hit You can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick I'm not a rapper, I'm a singer, I just take the piss And most of these other guys are kids that pose His little sister has to babysit, that's just the way it is Dreams are your own, just set your goals and have the upmost faith in it Tread your own path, you'll never make it as a follower You'll never know where you will go or you will be tomorrow Igh!

my mouth is full of saliva my knife is out and i'm ducking on the side of your house see it's sad it came to this point such a disappointment i had to make this appointment to come and see ya but i ain't here for your empathy i don't need your apology or your friendship or sympathy it's revenge that i seek so i sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window like i reach my full potentiali peeked

they say all of this is approaching its end but you refuse to believe that it's over here we go all over again back's to the wall i'm stacking up all them odds toilets clogged yeah cause i'm talking a lot of shit but i'm backing it all up but in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollers after the track is demolished i am your lack of a conscience i'm the ringing in your ears i'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils eating your vocal cords after your concerts i'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged grab for some water but i'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow i'm the bullies you hate that you became with every faggot you slaughtered coming back on ya every woman you insult batter but the doublestandard you have when it comes to your daughters i represent everything you take for granted cause marshall mathers the rapper's persona is half a facade and matthew and stan's just symbolic of you not knowing what you had 'til it's gone cause after all the glitz and the glam no more fans that are calling your name cameras are off sad but it happens to all of them i'm the hindsight to say i told you so foreshadows of all the things that are to follow i'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow if you don't stop after they call ya biggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quits when it's time to walk away i'm every guilt trip the

She put you in her brother's hands only for him to formulate another plan He's the fucking cause of your appalling state, this summer Fancy that, you came to London to get pimped by your uncle, damn   She's just under the upper hand Goes mad for a couple grams And she don't wanna go outside, tonight Cause in a pipe she'll fly to the motherland and Sell love to another man It's too cold outside For angels to fly   An angel will die Covered in white Closed eyes and hoping for a better life This time, we'll fade out tonight Straight down the line   Little lady, you're trembling with fear Your skinny frame kinda resembles a deer You're sitting facing the detective, oh dear The meddling nurse couldn't just leave it She's only gone and made it much worse calling police and She'll never know the gravity of the damage she's caused You're causing scandal going mad in the ward now The cop is trying to calm you, telling you he won't let no one harm you The same question he keeps trying to ask you, Who you working for? He's talking to you like you're worth more than a dirty whore You're having a conversation you could be murdered for You're learning more about exactly why you need to help bring him or her to court It's kicking knowledge you ain't ever heard before Just before he leaves, he reassures you that he knows that it's hard He underlines a mobile number you can phone on his card Begs you to use it, he's useless if you're gonna be stupid Cause an answer hasn't come from your bruised lips, you're on your own You've gotta go and give your pimp what you owe You reach your door and then it dawns that you've been followed home Before you turn around you feel a cold blade on your throat And then a voice says, Where you been bitch? I wanna know No prizes for guessing who it is, resistance would be foolishness You open the front door, he boots you in There's something new in him, he's silent now that fills you with terror Get your alibi straight, you could be killed for an error He towers over you, the 6 inch knife catches the sunlight At this point your life flashes before your eyes, your handbag's dropped And all the contents are all over the floor Despite the mess there's only one thing that's caught his eye And in the moment of rage, he brutally murders his niece And dumps her body in the boot of his Mercs in the street Little lady left this earth in the worst way All because she got a card on her 13th birthday   And we're all under the upper hand And go mad for a couple grams And we don't wanna go outside, tonight Cause in a pipe she'll fly to the motherland and Sell love to another man It's too cold outside For angels to fly For angels to fly Fly, fly For angels to fly To fly, to fly Angels to die
